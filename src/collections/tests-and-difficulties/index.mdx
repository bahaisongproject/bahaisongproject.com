<Prose>
  Songs based on a prayer attributed to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá:
  <blockquote>
    O God! Refresh and gladden my spirit. Purify my heart. Illumine my powers. I
    lay all my affairs in Thy hand. Thou art my Guide and my Refuge. I will no
    longer be sorrowful and grieved; I will be a happy and joyful being. O God!
    I will no longer be full of anxiety, nor will I let trouble harass me. I
    will not dwell on the unpleasant things of life. O God! Thou art more friend
    to me than I am to myself. I dedicate myself to Thee, O Lord.
