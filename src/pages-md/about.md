> Therefore … set to music the verses and the divine words so that they may be sung with soul-stirring melody in the Assemblies and gatherings, and that the hearts of the listeners may become tumultuous and rise towards the Kingdom of Abhá in supplication and prayer.
> — ʻAbdu'l-Bahá

bahá’í song project was launched in 2011 by a group of friends who wanted to encourage others to sing and play Bahá’í songs in their communities. Over the years it has become a resource for people from all around the world who share the understanding that singing prayers and sacred verses can bring much joy and vibrancy to a community, and resources for learning to sing and play songs should be easily accessible. We hope this website can serve as a tool to create a joyous and uplifting atmosphere in your communities.
